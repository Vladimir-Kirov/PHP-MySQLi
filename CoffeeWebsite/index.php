<h3>About Coffee</h3>
<h5>Coffee’s universal appeal:</h5>
<p>
    It is estimated that more than two billion cups are drunk worldwide every day. What is it about coffee that 
    makes it the world’s favourite beverage? Many would point to its unique, instantly recognizable aroma that 
    seems to improve our mood, even before we take a sip.
</p>
<p>
    According to the U.S. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, not only does the aroma of brewed coffee 
    cause pleasure, it also has powerful antioxidant properties, neutralizing free radicals and thus protecting the 
    body’s cells from damage caused by stress. Once we do actually take a sip of this tantalizing brew, we are 
    infused with a sense of well-being - both relaxed and invigorated, exhilarated yet clearheaded.

<h3>Caffeine</h3>
<h5>CAFFEINE CONTENTS</h5>

<h5>COFFEE</h5> 
<p>
    The amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee can vary greatly, depending
    on its origin or the composition of the blend, the method of brewing 
    and the strength of the brew. Instant, or soluble, coffee generally 
    contains less caffeine than roast and ground coffee, but may be consumed in greater volume.
    Robusta coffees have about twice as much caffeine as arabicas. A "cup" is usually understood
    to contain 150 ml (5 oz in the United States) but an espresso may be as small as 40 ml. <br/>
    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gives the following ranges for caffeine contents:

    (mg per 5 oz cup)

<h3>Coffee is </h3>

    the second most traded commodity on earth. One of the most popular drinks in the world.
    It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways. The effect of coffee on human health has been
    a subject of many studies; however, results have varied in terms of coffee`s relative benefit.
    The majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly 
    beneficial in healthy adults.

 a commodity as sugar or coffee and I will pay more 
for that ability than for any other under the sun.</q>
